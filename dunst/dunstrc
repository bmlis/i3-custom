# Every section that isn't one of the above is interpreted as a rules to

# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by

#
# NOTE: if you don't want a notification to be displayed, set the format
# to "".
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order
# to find fitting options for rules.
